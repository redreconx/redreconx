  <p class="mb-4">
    I'm Umakanth, an ethical hacker and red team enthusiast based in Hyderabad, India. With over 2.7 years of experience in IT support and a strong foundation in Windows and Linux systems, I've transitioned into the offensive side of cybersecurity to master real-world attack techniques, malware development, and red team operations.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I’ve practiced hundreds of labs from PortSwigger, HTB Academy, and self-hosted virtual machines — gaining expertise in web security, privilege escalation, C2 frameworks, and detection evasion.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    My goal with <strong>RedReconX</strong> is not just to showcase my skills, but to build a brand around stealthy recon, red team simulations, and creative offensive tooling. I want to help organizations and individuals learn, secure, and think like real adversaries.
  </p>

    Certifications: CEH | Post Graduate Program in Cybersecurity (Great Lakes) | Currently focusing on CRTO/OSCP-level expertise.
